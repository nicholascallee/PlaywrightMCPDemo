Use the Playwright MCP Server to create Playwright supporting framework for the 2 current Playwright tests.
All the work of creating the code for the browser automation must be routed through the MCP Server. Do not simulate interactions or bypass the MCP in any part of the flow during code creation.

1. login page
2. inventory page
3. base page

put any shared logic in the base page and have the other 2 pages inherit the base page.
change the current typescript files so they make use of the 2 pages files.
put the new page files under the PlaywrightPages folder

Create a readmePageObjectModel.md file to explain the new structure of the project.
