Use the Playwright MCP Server to create Playwright supporting framework for the 2 current Playwright tests.
All the work of creating the code for the browser automation must be routed through the MCP Server. Do not simulate interactions or bypass the MCP in any part of the flow during code creation.

expand on the current page object model strucured framework by adding:
1. base elements page
2. inventory elements page
3. login elements page

put any shared elements in the base elements page and have the other 2 elements pages inherit the base elements page.
change the current typescript page files so they make use of the 2 elements pages files.
put the new page files under the PlaywrightPages folder

Create a readmeElementsPageObjectModel.md file to explain the new structure of the project.
