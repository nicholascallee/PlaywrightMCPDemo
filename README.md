A repo containing AI generated Playwright tests and the prompts used to generate them.

All development work has taken place inside of Cursor through AI chat prompts.

This makes use of the Playwright MCP Server provided here: https://github.com/executeautomation/mcp-playwright

I created the prompts and pass them into the ai. Then the AI creates the required files and an accompaning readme to explain the created test.
